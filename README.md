## Overview

PrediRep is a deep learning network inspired by predictive coding, a neuroscientific theory of information processing in the brain. This repository hosts the implementation and details of the PrediRep model. PrediRep is an improved model over other similar predictive    coding inspired deep learning models such as PredNet and PreCNet. It achieves closer functional and structural alignment with predictive coding while maintaining comparable computational performance.

## Features

Detailed documentation on the PrediRep architecture, training process, and analyses. Also includes implementations of PredNet, PreCNet and RBP. 

## Setup

To quickly get started with PrediRep you first need to create a conda environment. The conva environment should be created from the environment.yml file, which allows for a quick way to set up the environment to run PrediRep. Help on how to do this can be found under https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html. Once you have created the environment, you first need to go to the following directory: WHERE_YOUR_ANACONDA_IS_STORED/anaconda3/envs/predirep/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keras/engine. You then need to copy the savings.py file found in the setup directory of this repository to the mentioned directory and overwrite the file currently found there. After this, you can run the scripts with the pre-trained PrediRep model.
